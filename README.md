## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the project I spent time reinforcing previous knowledge and practices that I learned from completing other Frontend Mentor projects. One thing I learned was how to utilize grids to create interesting shapes out of elements. I also managed to do the project from start to finish in 4 and a half hours, which I am very proud of.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to continue speeding up my workflow so that I can create a whole website in a day instead of taking multiple hours to complete a singular website. I also plan to begin learning javascript so that I can implement it in projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](developer.mozilla.org) - I referred to the MDN web docs often to look for practical examples of certain elements that I could implement in the project.
